           Hillside Handmade is a custom sewing studio. It’s also about fifteen years in the making. I’m Lindsay Schmidt, the owner and sewist (that’s what all the cool kids are saying these days) at Hillside Handmade. My grandmother taught me to sew as a child, I would sit under her quilting frame with her fabric scraps and a needle and thread and create something, pretty hideous usually, of my own. As a young adult I started making bags and quilts and shortly after that began working at a bridal shop as a seamstress. I learned so many tricks of the trade while working there, not realizing at the time how valuable those lessons would be. I left the bridal shop to take an office job, where I stayed in that field for twelve years. I continued to sew occasionally and always wanted to branch out and have a business of my own. Finally in 2017 I began to focus on my sewing and creative work again. I took on some contract work as a quilter for a modern quilting company, Vacilando Quilting Co., and began to realize again how much I love working with my hands. Hillside Handmade is my way of keeping the creativity flowing and also providing lessons for those who are also interested in diving into the sewing world, it can be so rewarding to see your idea come to fruition. Can’t wait to sew with you!
